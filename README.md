Project Description

This project is a web-based application for text encryption and decryption using multiple algorithms. It aims to provide a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to input text, select an encryption algorithm, and receive either the encrypted or decrypted output.
Requirements

    Encrypt Text: Users can enter plain text, select an encryption algorithm, and receive the encrypted output.
    Decrypt Text: Users can enter encrypted text, choose a decryption algorithm, and convert it back to plain text.

User Interface

    A text input area for users to enter text.
    A dropdown menu or radio buttons to select the encryption/decryption algorithm.
    Two buttons: one for Encrypt and one for Decrypt.
    An output area to display the result.

Algorithms Used

    Caesar Cipher
    Base64
    AES

Implementation Steps

    Create a simple HTML structure.
    Style the page using CSS for better readability and user experience.
    Write JavaScript functions for each encryption and decryption method.

Testing

    Test each algorithm to ensure they work correctly.

Deliverables

    Final files: index.html, style.css, script.js.

Notes

This project provides hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while applying encryption techniques.
